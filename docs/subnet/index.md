## Architecture
The architecture consists of the following key components owned by the customer:

- A subnet driven by the XDC2.0 consensus engine, with system configurations tailored for the customer
- A relayer program that checkpoint critical consensus data of the subnet to the XDC Mainnet
- A smart contract in the XDC Mainnet that verifies and records the checkpoints
- Wallet APIs that enable additional protection of subnet transaction from the XDC Mainnet
- The subnet will also natively support XDC's abundant utility tools such as blockchain explorer and forensic monitor
