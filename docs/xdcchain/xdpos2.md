## XDPoS 2.0

Sitting at the core of the XDC Network, XinFin Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol 2.0 (XDPoS 2.0) regulates the XDC nodes in maintaining the consistency of a decentralized ledger (the blockchain) with strong security and performance guarantees. In this section, we provide an overview of XDPoS 2.0 by introducing its three pillars, including:

1. Master node election, which specifies how the delegation and proof-of-stake works.

2. The consensus engine, namely, the HotStuff state machine replication (SMR) protocol, which is the state-of-the-art BFT (Byzantine fault-tolerant) SMR (state-machine replication) protocol. An illustration of its position in XDPoS 2.0 and a brief security analysis will be provided.

3. Reward mechanism, which incentivizes nodes to join and maintain the XDC Network.
