# Apothem Testnet RPC
The Apothem Testnet is the test environment for the XDC Network. It mirrors the Mainnet's functionality but operates with test tokens instead of real assets, making it ideal for developers to test and deploy their applications before going live.

**Public Networks**
Similar to the Mainnet, users can access the Apothem Testnet with an internet connection and full node RPC. They can perform all the same actions as on the Mainnet—reading, creating, or validating transactions—without the risks associated with live transactions.
