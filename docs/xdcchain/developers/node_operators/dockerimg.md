# Docker Image for the XDC Network

## What is a Docker Image?

A Docker image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run an application, including code, runtime, libraries, and configurations. In the context of blockchain, Docker images simplify the deployment and management of nodes by enabling developers to encapsulate the entire blockchain environment into a single, replicable package.

## Purpose of the XDC Network's Docker Image
For the XDC Network, the Docker image provides a standardized and efficient way for developers to deploy, manage, and update their XDC nodes. The XDC Docker image streamlines the node deployment process, reducing configuration errors and minimizing setup time. It allows developers to run nodes in isolated containers, ensuring a consistent environment across different infrastructures.

## Key features of the XDC Docker image include:

1. Ease of Deployment: Developers can deploy XDC nodes with just a few simple commands, reducing the complexity of setup.
2. Portability: Docker images are portable, meaning they can run consistently across various platforms, including local machines, cloud environments, and virtualized infrastructure.
3. Version Control: The XDC Docker image includes versioning, allowing developers to choose specific versions for compatibility testing or deployment.
4. Improved Security: Isolated environments reduce security risks as each container runs independently from the host system.
