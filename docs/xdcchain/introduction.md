# Introduction

XinFinâ€™s XDC Network is an enterprise-ready, Layer-1, EVM-compatible, open-source, hybrid blockchain protocol specializing in tokenization for real-world decentralized finance. It uses a special type of delegated proof-of-stake (XDPoS) for consensus to ensure quick transaction times, minimal gas fees, and a remarkable 2,000+ transactions per second (TPS).

XDC Network is backed by the XDC Community, leading to the formation of the XDC Foundation, which was established in 2021 to promote the growth and adoption of XDC through collaboration with a community of developers, trade experts, and content creators.
